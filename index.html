        <p>A <strong>white hat</strong> (or a<strong> white-hat hacker, a whitehat</strong>) is an ethical <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker"> Security Hacker</a><sup>[1][2]</sup> Ethical
            hacking is a term meant to imply a broader category than just penetration testing.<sup>[3][4]</sup> Under
            the owner's consent, white-hat hackers aim to identify any vulnerabilities the current system
            has.<sup>[5]</sup> The white hat is contrasted with the black hat, a malicious hacker; this definitional
            dichotomy comes from Western films, where heroic and antagonistic cowboys might traditionally wear a white
            and a black hat, respectively.<sup>[6]</sup> There is a third kind of hacker known as a grey hat who hacks
            with good intentions but at times without permission.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
        <p>White-hat hackers may also work in teams called "sneakers and/or hacker clubs",<sup>[8]</sup> red teams, or
            tiger teams.<sup>[9]</sup></p>

                <p>One of the first instances of an ethical hack being used was a "security evaluation" conducted by the
                    United States Air Force, in which the Multics operating systems were tested for "potential use as a
                    two-level (secret/top secret) system." The evaluation determined that while Multics was
                    "significantly better than other conventional systems," it also had "... vulnerabilities in hardware
                    security, software security and procedural security" that could be uncovered with "a relatively low
                    level of effort."<sup>[10]</sup> The authors performed their tests under a guideline of realism, so
                    their results would accurately represent the kinds of access an intruder could potentially achieve.
                    They performed tests involving simple information-gathering exercises, as well as outright attacks
                    upon the system that might damage its integrity; both results were of interest to the target
                    audience. There are several other now unclassified reports describing ethical hacking activities
                    within the US military.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>By 1981 The New York Times described white-hat activities as part of a "mischievous but perversely
                    positive 'hacker' tradition". When a National CSS employee revealed the existence of his password
                    cracker, which he had used on customer accounts, the company chastised him not for writing the
                    software but for not disclosing it sooner. The letter of reprimand stated "The Company realizes the
                    benefit to NCSS and encourages the efforts of employees to identify security weaknesses to the VP,
                    the directory, and other sensitive software in files".<sup>[11]</sup></p>

                <p>While penetration testing concentrates on attacking software and computer systems from the start –
                    scanning ports, examining known defects in protocols and applications running on the system, and
                    patch installations, for example – ethical hacking may include other things. A full-blown ethical
                    hack might include emailing staff to ask for password details, rummaging through executive dustbins
                    and usually breaking, without the knowledge and consent of the targets. Only the owners, CEOs, and
                    Board Members (stakeholders) who asked for such a security review of this magnitude are aware. To
                    try and replicate some of the destructive techniques a real attack might employ, ethical hackers may
                    arrange for cloned test systems, or organize a hack late at night while systems are less
                    <sup>[12]</sup> In most recent cases these hacks perpetuate for the long-term con (days, if not
                    weeks, of long-term human infiltration into an organization). Some examples include leaving
                    USB/flash key drives with hidden auto-start software in a public area as if someone lost the small
                    drive and an unsuspecting employee found it and took it.</p>

                <p>Struan Robertson, legal director at Pinsent Masons LLP, and editor of OUT-LAW.com says "Broadly
                    speaking, if the access to a system is authorized, the hacking is ethical and legal. If it isn't,
                    there's an offense under the Computer Misuse Act. The unauthorized access offense covers everything
                    from guessing the password to accessing someone's webmail account, to cracking the security of a
                    bank. The maximum penalty for unauthorized access to a computer is two years in prison and a fine.
                    There are higher penalties – up to 10 years in prison – when the hacker also modifies data".
                    Unauthorized access even to expose vulnerabilities for the benefit of many is not legal, says
                    Robertson. "There's no defense in our hacking laws that your behavior is for the greater good. Even
                    if it's what you believe."<sup>[4]</sup></p>

                <p>The United States National Security Agency offers certifications such as the CNSS 4011. Such a
                    certification covers orderly, ethical hacking techniques and team management. Aggressor teams are
                    called "red" teams. Defender teams are called "blue" teams.<sup>[8]</sup> When the agency recruited
                    at DEF CON in 2012, it promised applicants that "If you have a few, shall we say, indiscretions in
                    your past, don't be alarmed. You shouldn't automatically assume you won't be hired".<sup>[13]</sup>

                <p>A good "white hat" is a competitive skillful employee for an enterprise since they can be a
                    countermeasure to find the bugs to protect the enterprise network environment. Therefore, a good
